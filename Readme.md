# HTML Explorer

  Node experimentation

## Getting started

```js
npm install
node server.js
```
  The application is then accessible at http://localhost:8080.

## Known Issues
  - HTTPS requests currently timeout and are thus unsupported
  - Responsiveness behaves well down to 800px in screen width
  - Browser crashes on Twitter.com
